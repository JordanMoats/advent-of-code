# To Run
First, clone the repository:
`git clone {INSERT LINK HERE}`

Ensure you have Node installed.
Once node is installed, you can globally install typescript and ts-node with the following command:
`npm install -g ts-node typescript`

To run a file, use:
`ts-node {FILENAME}`

For example, if I wanted to run Part B of Day 4 in 2023, I would use:
`ts-node 2023/Day4/B.ts`
